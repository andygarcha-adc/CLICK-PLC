# node-red-contrib-c2nred-mqtt
MQTT Broker for CLICK C2-NRED Node-RED modules based on [node-red-contrib-aedes](https://github.com/martin-doyle/node-red-contrib-aedes) which is based on [Aedes](https://github.com/moscajs/aedes).
**PLEASE FIX ME! I DO NOT HAVE GITHUB LINK YET**

You can use the MQTT protocol in Node-RED without an external MQTT broker like Mosquitto.

## Background

## Installation
You can install the node directly within the editor by using the [Palette Manager](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/palette/manager).

## Flows
Just put this node on Node-RED and hit the deploy button. The MQTT Broker will run on your Node-RED instance.

For more information see ???.

## Server without public IP or behind firewall
If your server is behind a firewall or you cannot open any ports other than the standard http/https ports, the MQTT broker node can be accessible by public clients through a WebSocket path.

When your Node-RED server address is `https://yourserver/`, you can set the WebSocket to bind to, e.g., `"/ws/mqtt"` path, to have `wss://yourserver/ws/mqtt` WebSocket at port `443`.

You can also bind the WebSocket to the root `"/"` path and having `wss://yourserver/` WebSocket listening at port `443` (or `ws://yourserver/` at port `80`).
